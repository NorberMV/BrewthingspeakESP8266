*IoT for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi microchip, here I work with the WeMos D1 mini specially,
*Need to include the library secrets.h and modified it with the local network and Thigspeaks API key
*information.
The ThigspeakMultipleFields.ino code, have been modified from official ThingSpeak Copyright 2018, The MathWorks, Inc. to read two sensors DS18B20 and a MQ-4 1 Methane meter, compressed natural gas (GNP) and writes in a
